			<p class="flavor"> Leipori are a rabbit-like species that appear to largely live in caverns under the Enchanted Forest known as 'The Burrows'.

			<p>Most leipori dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Leipori depend on their magical abilities in day to day life. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few leipori venture into the outside world to further their studies and broaden their horizons.</p>
